# Vestige

> *Previously "Afterworld Archive" — renamed to better reflect the project's direction toward memory, discovery, and interactive exploration.*

**Vestige** is a conceptual Unity prototype exploring narrative systems and world-building mechanics. It's an experimental sandbox for creature discovery, environmental storytelling, and archive-based progression.

## What This Prototype Explores

- **Creature Discovery** — Encounter and catalog mysterious beings in an open world
- **Scanning Mechanics** — Hold-to-scan system for logging discoveries and building knowledge
- **Archive Progression** — Unlock creature lore, behaviors, and instincts through repeated encounters
- **Procedural Ambience** — Self-contained audio atmosphere without external sound files
- **Memory Systems** — Save/load progression tied to what you've discovered

## What You Can Do Right Now

1. **Move** — Third-person controller with WASD movement and camera-relative direction
2. **Explore** — Navigate a minimal scene with procedural ambient audio
3. **Scan** — Hold to scan creatures and objects in the world
4. **Catalog** — Build an archive of creature knowledge through discovery

This is a **work-in-progress prototype**. Systems are functional but minimal — the focus is on exploring game feel and narrative mechanics, not production polish.

## Development Status

🧪 **Conceptual / Experimental**

This project is a creative sandbox for testing ideas. Expect rough edges, placeholder content, and systems that may change significantly.

## Run Locally

1. Open with **Unity 2022.3.10f1** (or compatible 2022.3 LTS)
2. Load scene: `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity`
3. Enter Play Mode

## Build

Use Unity's standard build pipeline (File → Build Settings). Ensure `Main.unity` is included in build settings.

## Documentation

See [`/docs`](docs/overview.md) for technical details and system breakdowns.
